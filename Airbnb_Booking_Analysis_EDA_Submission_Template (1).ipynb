The dataset contains detailed information about over 48,000 listings across five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island. Key attributes include host details, neighborhood, room type, price, availability, and number of reviews. The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns in pricing, availability, and spatial distribution of listings. Descriptive statistics and visualizations are used to explore the popularity of different boroughs and room types. The project also investigates factors influencing listing prices and identifies outliers. We examine which areas have the highest listing density and how prices vary across neighborhoods. Insights are drawn on affordability, host activity, and seasonal availability. Findings can support better decision-making for travelers, hosts, and policy-makers by understanding trends in the short-term rental market in NYC."

        "The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset contains detailed information about 48,895 Airbnb listings across New York City’s five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island. The dataset includes 16 columns, featuring attributes such as listing ID, name, host details, location, room type, price, number of reviews, and availability. The most common room types are entire homes/apartments, private rooms, and shared rooms. An initial check shows there are no duplicate rows in the dataset. However, some missing values are present, particularly in the name, host_name, last_review, and reviews_per_month columns — with the last two missing in over 10,000 rows, likely due to listings that have not received any reviews. The data types include a mix of strings, numerical values, and dates. This dataset is ideal for exploring pricing trends, room availability, neighborhood popularity, and host activity, and can support decisions for hosts, travelers, and city policymakers alike."

Through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, we discovered that listings with lower prices, shorter minimum stays, and higher availability tend to receive more reviews — indicating higher guest engagement and booking activity.   \n",

High-performing hosts and room types (especially entire homes and private rooms) consistently drive positive outcomes, while outliers reveal areas of improvement such as overpricing and limited availability.  \n",
